My name's Alec,

I'm currently a student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
I haven't figured out what field I would like to work in as I don't have much experience outside of school.
I'm not an expert in anything, but I have taken classes in JAVA, C, and MySQL. I've also been through a Cyber Security Course.
