Hi, I'm Alec

I'm currently a student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
I haven't figured out what field I would like to work in as I don't have much experience outside of school.
I'm currently taking a class in JAVA but I have also had technical training in Cyber Security.
To be continued...
