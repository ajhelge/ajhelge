My name's Alec,

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at NDSU. I've also been through the Joint Cyber Analysis Course
at the Center for Information Warfare Training Command in Pensacola Florida. 
I haven't figured out what field I would like to work in as I don't have much experience outside of school.
